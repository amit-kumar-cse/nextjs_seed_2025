# Authentication with Clerk

This project uses Clerk for authentication. Here's how it's set up:

## Key Components

- [src/middleware.ts](mdc:src/middleware.ts): Defines protected and public routes
- [src/app/layout.tsx](mdc:src/app/layout.tsx): Contains the ClerkProvider and authentication UI components

## Authentication Flow

1. The ClerkProvider wraps the entire application to provide auth context
2. The middleware protects routes except those specified in publicRoutes
3. SignedIn/SignedOut components conditionally render based on auth state
4. SignInButton/SignUpButton components handle the login/signup process
5. UserButton displays the authenticated user's information

## Environment Variables

Remember to set up your .env.local file with:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```
